House Price Prediction App

This is a web application built with Python and Streamlit to predict house prices based on various input features. The app uses a machine learning model trained on historical housing data to provide accurate price estimates.

Features:<br/>
-> User-friendly interface to input house details like area, number of rooms, location, etc.<br/>
-> Real-time house price prediction.<br/>
-> Integration with a pre-trained machine learning model.<br/>
-> Easy to deploy and run locally or on a cloud platform.<br/>

Prerequisites:<br/>
Python 3.8 or higher<br/>
Pip package manager<br/>

Technologies Used:<br/>
Python: Core programming language.<br/>
Streamlit: Framework for building interactive web apps.<br/>
Scikit-learn: For training and using the machine learning model.<br/>
Pandas: Data manipulation and preprocessing.<br/>
Numpy: Numerical computations.
