**House Price Prediction App**
This is a web application built with Python and Streamlit to predict house prices based on various input features. The app uses a machine learning model trained on historical housing data to provide accurate price estimates.

Features:
-> User-friendly interface to input house details like area, number of rooms, location, etc.
-> Real-time house price prediction.
-> Integration with a pre-trained machine learning model.
-> Easy to deploy and run locally or on a cloud platform.

Prerequisites:
Python 3.8 or higher
Pip package manager

Technologies Used:
Python: Core programming language.
Streamlit: Framework for building interactive web apps.
Scikit-learn: For training and using the machine learning model.
Pandas: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
Numpy: Numerical computations.
